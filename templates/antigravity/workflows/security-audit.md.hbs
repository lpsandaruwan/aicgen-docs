description: Perform comprehensive security audit of the codebase
---

* Scan code for common security vulnerabilities:
  - SQL injection risks
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
  - Command injection possibilities
  - Path traversal issues
  - Insecure cryptography usage
  - Hardcoded secrets or credentials
* Check authentication and authorization logic
* Review input validation and sanitization
* Examine error handling for information leakage
* Verify secure handling of sensitive data
* Check for proper use of security headers
* Review third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities
* Suggest remediation steps for identified issues
* Provide code examples for fixes
* Prioritize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
