# CI/CD Practices

## Continuous Integration

Run on every commit:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

## Continuous Deployment

Deploy automatically after CI passes:

```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build
    - run: npm run deploy
      env:
        DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
Run two identical environments, switch traffic instantly.

### Canary Releases
Route small percentage of traffic to new version first.

### Rolling Updates
Gradually replace instances with new version.

## Best Practices

- Run fast tests first, slow tests later
- Cache dependencies between runs
- Use matrix builds for multiple versions/platforms
- Keep secrets in secure storage
- Automate database migrations
- Include rollback procedures
- Monitor deployments with health checks
- Use feature flags for safer releases
