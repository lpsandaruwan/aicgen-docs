description: Generate integration tests for API endpoints and system components
---

* Identify integration points (APIs, databases, external services)
* Create integration test files following project conventions
* Generate tests that verify:
  - End-to-end workflows across multiple components
  - API endpoint request/response cycles
  - Database transactions and data persistence
  - External service integrations
* Use test fixtures and factories for realistic data
* Include proper setup and teardown for test environments
* Mock external dependencies appropriately
* Test error scenarios and edge cases
* Ensure tests are idempotent and can run in any order
* Add clear documentation for test prerequisites
