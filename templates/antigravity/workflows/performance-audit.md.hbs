description: Analyze code for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
---

* Profile the code to identify performance hotspots
* Check for common performance issues:
  - N+1 query problems in database access
  - Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) or worse where O(n log n) possible)
  - Unnecessary loops or iterations
  - Missing database indexes
  - Redundant API calls or computations
  - Memory leaks or excessive memory usage
  - Blocking operations that could be async
* Analyze caching opportunities:
  - Frequently accessed data
  - Expensive computations
  - External API responses
* Review resource management:
  - Connection pooling
  - File handle management
  - Memory allocation patterns
* Suggest specific optimizations with code examples
* Estimate performance impact of suggested changes
* Prioritize recommendations by expected impact
