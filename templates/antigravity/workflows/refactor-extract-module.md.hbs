description: Extract code into a separate, reusable module
---

* Identify the code section to extract
* Analyze dependencies and determine module interface
* Create a new module file following project structure conventions
* Extract the selected code maintaining:
  - Original functionality and behavior
  - Proper error handling
  - Type safety and contracts
* Update imports and exports appropriately
* Refactor the original code to use the new module
* Ensure no circular dependencies are introduced
* Add appropriate documentation to the new module
* Update tests to cover the new module independently
* Verify all existing tests still pass after refactoring
